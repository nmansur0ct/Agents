# TPM 1-Hour Agentic Programming Learning Session

## üéØ **Session Overview for Technical Program Managers**

This 1-hour session is designed for TPMs with limited coding experience to understand and modify agentic programming concepts. You'll learn by making practical changes to the Feature Prioritization Assistant.

## üìã **Session Structure**

### **10 minutes**: Understanding Agentic Architecture
### **35 minutes**: Hands-on Coding (3 exercises)
### **15 minutes**: Testing and Validation

---

## üß† **Part 1: Quick Agentic Concepts (10 minutes)**

### What Makes Code "Agentic"?

**Traditional Code:**
```python
if "payment" in description:
    return 0.8  # Fixed rule
```

**Agentic Code:**
```python
def payment_analysis_agent(description):
    """I am an agent that analyzes payment features"""
    # Agent reasons about the specific context
    return llm_analysis(description, my_expertise="payment_systems")
```

**Key Differences:**
- ‚úÖ **Agents have identity** and specific roles
- ‚úÖ **Agents make decisions** based on context  
- ‚úÖ **Agents can reason** and explain their decisions
- ‚úÖ **Agents collaborate** by passing information

## üõ† **Part 2: Hands-On Coding Exercises (35 minutes)**

### **Exercise 1: Customize Business Keywords (15 minutes)**
*Perfect for TPMs - No complex programming required*

**What You'll Learn:**
- How agents use business knowledge
- How to encode domain expertise
- Impact of keyword mappings on decisions

**Your Task:** Add your company's specific business keywords

**File to Edit:** `config.py` (lines 42-85)

**Current Code:**
```python
keyword_mappings: Dict[str, Dict[str, float]] = Field(
    default_factory=lambda: {
        # High revenue keywords
        "pricing": {"revenue": 0.9, "engineering": 0.4},
        "payment": {"revenue": 0.9, "engineering": 0.6},
        "subscription": {"revenue": 0.8, "engineering": 0.6},
        
        # Add your keywords here...
    }
)
```

**Your Mission:** Add 5 keywords specific to your business domain

**Example for E-commerce:**
```python
# Add these to the keyword_mappings dictionary:
"cart-abandonment": {"revenue": 0.8, "reach": 0.7},
"personalization": {"revenue": 0.7, "complexity": 0.6},
"inventory": {"risk_reduction": 0.8, "engineering": 0.5},
"recommendations": {"revenue": 0.6, "complexity": 0.7},
"wishlist": {"reach": 0.6, "engineering": 0.3},
```

**Validation Test:**
```bash
python run.py --json '[{"name": "Cart abandonment email", "description": "Send personalized cart-abandonment emails with inventory updates"}]' --verbose
```

**Expected Outcome:** The agent should recognize your keywords and adjust factors accordingly.

### **Exercise 2: Create a Custom Agent Prompt (15 minutes)**
*Learn how agents think and communicate*

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to give agents personality and expertise
- How agent identity affects decision-making
- How to constrain agent behavior

**Your Task:** Create a domain-specific agent prompt

**File to Edit:** `nodes.py` (lines 98-125)

**Current Agent:**
```python
prompt = f"""You are an agent for feature analysis and factor assessment. Your role is to analyze product features and estimate normalized business factors."""
```

**Your Mission:** Create a specialized agent for your domain

**Example for FinTech:**
```python
prompt = f"""You are an agent for financial technology feature analysis. Your expertise includes:
- Regulatory compliance requirements (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- Financial risk assessment and fraud prevention
- Banking integration complexity and security protocols
- Customer trust and adoption patterns in financial services

As a FinTech agent, you prioritize:
- Security and compliance as critical risk factors
- Customer trust and regulatory approval for reach assessment
- Integration complexity with banking systems for effort estimation

Analyze this financial feature: {feature_desc}

Apply your FinTech expertise to estimate factors..."""
```

**Alternative for Healthcare:**
```python
prompt = f"""You are an agent for healthcare technology feature analysis. Your expertise includes:
- HIPAA compliance and patient data protection
- Clinical workflow integration and provider adoption
- Patient safety and care quality impact assessment
- Healthcare system interoperability challenges

As a Healthcare agent, you prioritize:
- Patient safety and regulatory compliance as top risk factors
- Provider workflow disruption for effort assessment
- Patient care quality improvement for impact evaluation

Analyze this healthcare feature: {feature_desc}

Apply your healthcare expertise to estimate factors..."""
```

**Validation Test:**
```bash
python run.py --json '[{"name": "HIPAA-compliant messaging", "description": "Secure patient-provider messaging with audit trail"}]' --llm --verbose
```

**Expected Outcome:** Your specialized agent should show domain expertise in its analysis.

### **Exercise 3: Modify Agent Collaboration (5 minutes)**
*Understand how agents work together*

**What You'll Learn:**
- How agents pass information between stages
- How agent decisions build on each other
- How to add agent reasoning transparency

**Your Task:** Add collaborative reasoning between agents

**File to Edit:** `nodes.py` (lines 220-230)

**Current Code:**
```python
if llm_analysis:
    # Override defaults with LLM analysis where available
    for factor in ['reach', 'revenue', 'risk_reduction', 'engineering', 'dependency', 'complexity']:
        if factor in llm_analysis and llm_analysis[factor] is not None:
            defaults[factor] = max(0.0, min(1.0, llm_analysis[factor]))
    
    # Add LLM analysis notes
    if 'notes' in llm_analysis and llm_analysis['notes']:
        final_notes.extend([f"LLM: {note}" for note in llm_analysis['notes']])
```

**Your Mission:** Add agent collaboration notes

**Enhanced Code:**
```python
if llm_analysis:
    # Override defaults with LLM analysis where available
    for factor in ['reach', 'revenue', 'risk_reduction', 'engineering', 'dependency', 'complexity']:
        if factor in llm_analysis and llm_analysis[factor] is not None:
            old_value = defaults[factor]
            new_value = max(0.0, min(1.0, llm_analysis[factor]))
            defaults[factor] = new_value
            
            # Add collaboration transparency
            if abs(new_value - old_value) > 0.2:  # Significant change
                final_notes.append(f"Agent Override: {factor} changed from {old_value:.2f} to {new_value:.2f}")
    
    # Add LLM analysis notes with agent attribution
    if 'notes' in llm_analysis and llm_analysis['notes']:
        final_notes.extend([f"Analysis Agent: {note}" for note in llm_analysis['notes']])
        final_notes.append(f"Agent Collaboration: {len(llm_analysis['notes'])} insights provided")
```

**Validation Test:**
```bash
python run.py --file samples/features.json --llm --verbose | grep -i "agent"
```

**Expected Outcome:** See agent collaboration and decision transparency in the output.
