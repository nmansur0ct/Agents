# TPM 1-Hour Agentic Programming Learning Session

## 🎯 **Session Overview for Technical Program Managers**

This 1-hour session is designed for TPMs with limited coding experience to understand and implement agentic programming concepts. You'll learn by implementing the **FeasibilityAgent** - a specialized AI agent that transforms feature prioritization through intelligent risk assessment.

**Strategic Learning Objectives:**
- ✅ **Understand Agentic Architecture**: Learn how specialized agents collaborate to solve complex business problems
- ✅ **Implement Risk Intelligence**: Add automated risk assessment to your feature prioritization process
- ✅ **Configure Business Rules**: Set up risk policies that align with your organization's risk tolerance
- ✅ **Validate System Integration**: Ensure the FeasibilityAgent enhances rather than disrupts existing workflows

## 📋 **Session Structure**

### **10 minutes**: Understanding Agentic Architecture & Strategic Value
### **35 minutes**: Hands-on Implementation (FeasibilityAgent Configuration & Integration)
### **15 minutes**: Testing, Validation, and Business Impact Assessment

## 🆕 **What's New in This Session**

**FeasibilityAgent Implementation**: You'll add a new intelligent agent that:
- ✅ **Evaluates delivery risk** for each feature
- ✅ **Applies risk penalties** to priority scores  
- ✅ **Uses AI analysis** with deterministic fallback
- ✅ **Provides feasibility ratings** (High/Medium/Low)

---

## 🧠 **Part 1: Agentic Architecture & Strategic Value (10 minutes)**

### **What Makes Code "Agentic" and Why TPMs Should Care**

**Traditional Rule-Based Code:**
```python
# Static, inflexible business logic
if "payment" in description:
    return 0.8  # Fixed rule, no context awareness
```

**Agentic Code with Business Intelligence:**
```python
class FeasibilityAgent:
    """Specialized agent that understands implementation risk patterns"""
    
    def assess_feature(self, feature):
        # Agent analyzes multiple risk dimensions:
        # - Technical complexity patterns
        # - Historical delivery data
        # - Team capability alignment
        # - External dependency risks
        return self.analyze_with_ai(feature) or self.deterministic_fallback(feature)
```

**Strategic Advantages for TPMs:**
- ✅ **Adaptive Intelligence**: Agents learn from patterns rather than following rigid rules
- ✅ **Domain Expertise**: Each agent specializes in specific business problems (risk, scoring, prioritization)
- ✅ **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Agents work together, each contributing specialized insights
- ✅ **Explainable Decisions**: Agents provide reasoning for their assessments, enabling informed business decisions

### **The FeasibilityAgent Business Architecture**

**Agent Collaboration Model:**
```
Business Input → Extract Agent → FeasibilityAgent → Scorer Agent → Prioritizer Agent
                     ↓                ↓                ↓             ↓
              [Data Normalization] [Risk Intelligence] [Business Scoring] [Strategic Ranking]
```

**FeasibilityAgent's Strategic Role:**
- 🎯 **Risk Quantification**: Converts subjective "this feels risky" into measurable risk scores (0.0-1.0)
- 📊 **Business Intelligence**: Identifies patterns between feature characteristics and delivery outcomes
- ⚖️ **Resource Optimization**: Helps allocate appropriate technical talent to feature complexity levels
- 🛡️ **Stakeholder Protection**: Provides early warning system for potentially problematic features

**Why This Architecture Matters for TPMs:**
- **Scalable Decision-Making**: Consistent risk assessment across hundreds of features
- **Transparent Process**: Every risk score comes with explainable reasoning
- **Continuous Improvement**: Agents can be refined as delivery patterns emerge
- **Fallback Reliability**: System degrades gracefully when AI components are unavailable

## 🛠 **Part 2: Hands-On FeasibilityAgent Implementation (35 minutes)**

### **Exercise 1: Configure Risk Assessment Business Policies (12 minutes)**
*Strategic Focus: Encoding organizational risk tolerance and business rules*

**What You'll Learn as a TPM:**
- How to translate business risk tolerance into system configuration
- How to balance feature velocity with delivery predictability
- How risk penalty settings impact portfolio prioritization decisions
- How to configure fallback behavior for system reliability

**Your Strategic Task:** Configure the FeasibilityAgent to align with your organization's risk management approach

**File to Edit:** `config.py` (Business policy configuration)

**Step 1: Add Risk Policy Framework (around line 8)**
```python
class RiskPolicy(BaseModel):
    """Business risk assessment configuration for feature delivery evaluation."""
    risk_penalty: float = Field(default=0.5, ge=0, le=1, 
                               description="Risk penalty multiplier - how heavily risk impacts scoring")
    enable_feasibility_agent: bool = Field(default=True, 
                                          description="Enable automated risk assessment")
    use_llm_analysis: bool = Field(default=True, 
                                  description="Use AI analysis for enhanced risk evaluation")
```

**Step 2: Update Core Configuration (around line 30)**
```python
# Modify this line to enable AI enhancements by default:
llm_enabled: bool = Field(default=True, description="Enable LLM enhancements for factor analysis and rationale generation")

# Add after the monitoring field:
risk: RiskPolicy = Field(default_factory=lambda: RiskPolicy(), 
                        description="Risk assessment business rules and policies")
```

**Strategic Configuration Options for TPMs:**

```python
# Conservative Risk Management (Enterprise/Regulated Industries)
# Heavily penalize risky features to ensure predictable delivery
risk_penalty = 0.7  # 70% score reduction for high-risk features

# Balanced Risk Management (Most Organizations) 
# Moderate penalty balances innovation with predictability
risk_penalty = 0.5  # 50% score reduction for high-risk features (default)

# Aggressive Risk Management (Startups/Competitive Markets)
# Light penalty to maintain feature velocity despite risk
risk_penalty = 0.3  # 30% score reduction for high-risk features
```

**Business Impact Understanding:**
- **High Penalty (0.7)**: Prioritizes delivery certainty - fewer surprises, slower innovation
- **Medium Penalty (0.5)**: Balances speed and predictability - optimal for most teams
- **Low Penalty (0.3)**: Prioritizes feature velocity - accepts higher delivery uncertainty
```python
# Conservative (high risk penalty)
risk_penalty: float = 0.7  # 70% penalty for high-risk features

# Aggressive (low risk penalty) 
risk_penalty: float = 0.3  # 30% penalty for high-risk features

# Disable LLM, use only deterministic analysis
use_llm_analysis: bool = False
```

**Business Impact:** Risk penalty directly affects final scores - high-risk features get lower priority.

### **Exercise 3: Integrate Agent into Business Workflow (5 minutes)**
*Strategic Focus: Understanding how agents enhance existing business processes*

**What You'll Learn as a TPM:**
- How new business capabilities integrate into existing operational workflows
- How agent data enrichment improves downstream decision-making processes
- How to configure monitoring and audit trails for business compliance
- How to ensure business continuity during system changes

**Your Strategic Task:** Integrate the FeasibilityAgent into the feature prioritization business process

**Integration Philosophy:** The FeasibilityAgent enhances rather than replaces existing processes, adding risk intelligence without disrupting proven workflows.

**Files to Modify for Business Integration:**

**Step 1: Enhance Data Models** (`models.py`)
```python
# Add business-critical risk assessment fields to FeatureSpec class:
# (Insert after the existing notes field)

# Business Intelligence Fields - Enable risk-informed decision making
feasibility: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Implementation feasibility: Low|Medium|High")
risk_factor: Optional[float] = Field(0.4, ge=0, le=1, description="Risk factor (0=safe, 1=risky)")
delivery_confidence: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Confidence: Safe|MediumRisk|HighRisk")
```

**Step 2: Create Business Process Node** (`nodes.py`)
```python
# Add import for the new business intelligence agent
from agents_feasibility import FeasibilityAgent

# Add the risk assessment business process node
def feasibility_node(state: State, config: Optional[Config] = None) -> State:
    """
    Business Process: Risk Assessment and Delivery Confidence Evaluation
    Strategic Purpose: Add risk intelligence to feature evaluation workflow
    """
    print("🚀 Feasibility Node: Starting risk assessment")
    
    cfg = config or Config.default()
    
    # Apply business monitoring if enabled
    if cfg.monitoring.enabled:
        monitor = get_system_monitor()
        decorator = monitor.get_monitoring_decorator("feasibility_agent", "assess_risk")
        return decorator(_feasibility_node_impl)(state, cfg)
    else:
        return _feasibility_node_impl(state, cfg)

def _feasibility_node_impl(state: State, config: Optional[Config] = None) -> State:
    """Core risk assessment business logic implementation."""
    cfg = config or Config.default()
    
    if "errors" not in state:
        state["errors"] = []
    
    extracted_output = state.get("extracted")
    if not extracted_output or not hasattr(extracted_output, 'features'):
        state["errors"].append("feasibility_node:no_extracted_features")
        return state
    
    print(f"📋 Feasibility Node: Processing {len(extracted_output.features)} features")
    
    # Initialize and execute risk assessment business process
    feasibility_agent = FeasibilityAgent(cfg)
    enriched_features = feasibility_agent.enrich(extracted_output.features, state["errors"])
    
    # Update business state with risk-enriched features
    extracted_output.features = enriched_features
    state["extracted"] = extracted_output
    
    print("✅ Feasibility Node: Completed risk assessment")
    return state
```

**Step 3: Update Business Workflow** (`graph.py`)
```python
# Modify import statement to include the new business process
from nodes import extractor_node, feasibility_node, scorer_node, prioritizer_node

# In the _build_graph method, update the workflow to include risk assessment:
# Add the risk assessment business process node
workflow.add_node("feasibility", feasibility_with_config)

# Update business process flow to include risk assessment step
workflow.add_edge("extract", "feasibility")      # Extract → Risk Assessment
workflow.add_edge("feasibility", "score")        # Risk Assessment → Business Scoring  
```

**Strategic Business Workflow Enhancement:**
```
Before: Raw Features → Extract → Score → Prioritize → Business Decisions
After:  Raw Features → Extract → Risk Assessment → Score → Prioritize → Risk-Informed Decisions
                                      ↑
                        [FeasibilityAgent Business Intelligence]
```

**Business Value of Integration:**
- ✅ **Enhanced Decision Quality**: Risk intelligence improves prioritization accuracy
- ✅ **Process Transparency**: Clear audit trail for risk assessment decisions
- ✅ **Stakeholder Communication**: Risk categories facilitate business discussions
- ✅ **Operational Continuity**: Fallback mechanisms ensure business process reliability

**Business Validation Philosophy:** Systematic verification ensures the FeasibilityAgent enhances business decision-making without introducing operational risk.

### **Test 1: Business Configuration Validation (3 minutes)**
*Verify risk policies align with organizational strategy*

```bash
# Validate that business risk policies are properly configured
python -c "
from config import Config
config = Config.default()
print(f'✅ AI Enhancement Enabled: {config.llm_enabled}')
print(f'✅ Risk Penalty Setting: {config.risk.risk_penalty} (0.3=aggressive, 0.5=balanced, 0.7=conservative)')
print(f'✅ FeasibilityAgent Active: {config.risk.enable_feasibility_agent}')
print(f'✅ AI Analysis Mode: {config.risk.use_llm_analysis}')
print(f'📊 Business Impact: {\"High\" if config.risk.risk_penalty > 0.6 else \"Moderate\" if config.risk.risk_penalty > 0.4 else \"Low\"} risk sensitivity')
"
```

**Expected Strategic Output:**
```
✅ AI Enhancement Enabled: True
✅ Risk Penalty Setting: 0.5 (0.3=aggressive, 0.5=balanced, 0.7=conservative)
✅ FeasibilityAgent Active: True  
✅ AI Analysis Mode: True
📊 Business Impact: Moderate risk sensitivity
```

### **Test 2: Feature Risk Assessment Intelligence (5 minutes)**
*Validate agent provides actionable business intelligence*

```bash
# Test FeasibilityAgent with a complex business scenario
python -c "
from agents_feasibility import FeasibilityAgent
from config import Config
from models import FeatureSpec

config = Config.default()
agent = FeasibilityAgent(config)

# Test with a high-complexity strategic feature
strategic_feature = FeatureSpec(
    name='AI-Powered Customer Recommendations',
    reach=0.8, revenue=0.9, risk_reduction=0.3,
    engineering=0.9, dependency=0.7, complexity=0.9,
    notes=['machine learning', 'real-time processing', 'data pipeline integration']
)

result = agent.assess_feature(strategic_feature)
print(f'🎯 Business Scenario: {result.name}')
print(f'📊 Implementation Feasibility: {result.feasibility}')
print(f'⚖️ Risk Score: {result.risk_factor:.3f} (0.0=safe → 1.0=high risk)')
print(f'🛡️ Delivery Confidence: {result.delivery_confidence}')
print(f'💡 Strategic Implication: {\\"Requires senior engineering resources\\" if result.risk_factor > 0.7 else \\"Standard team can handle\\" if result.risk_factor < 0.4 else \\"Mixed skill team appropriate\\"}')
"
```

**Expected Business Intelligence Output:**
```
🤖 Analyzing feasibility for: AI-Powered Customer Recommendations
🔧 Using deterministic analysis for AI-Powered Customer Recommendations
🎯 Business Scenario: AI-Powered Customer Recommendations
📊 Implementation Feasibility: Low
⚖️ Risk Score: 0.867 (0.0=safe → 1.0=high risk)
🛡️ Delivery Confidence: HighRisk
💡 Strategic Implication: Requires senior engineering resources
```

### **Test 3: Complete Business Process Validation (7 minutes)**
*Verify end-to-end business workflow delivers risk-informed decisions*

```bash
# Test the complete business decision-making workflow
python run.py --json '[
{
  "name": "Mobile Payment Integration", 
  "description": "Integrate with Apple Pay and Google Pay for streamlined checkout",
  "engineering_hint": 4, 
  "complexity_hint": 3,

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues:**

**1. Import Errors**
```bash
# Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agents_feasibility'
# Solution: Ensure the file is created in the correct directory
ls -la agents_feasibility.py  # Should exist in feature_prioritizer/
```

**2. Configuration Errors**
```bash
# Error: AttributeError: 'Config' object has no attribute 'risk'
# Solution: Ensure RiskPolicy is added to config.py and imported correctly
```

**3. Risk Fields Missing**
```bash
# Error: TypeError: __init__() missing required positional arguments
# Solution: Add risk fields to FeatureSpec model in models.py
```

**4. LLM Not Working**
```bash
# Test LLM connectivity
python -c "
import os
print('OpenAI Key:', 'Found' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_AGENT_KEY') else 'Missing')
"
# Solution: Create .env file with OPENAI_API_AGENT_KEY=your-key-here
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips for TPMs**

### **1. Start with Deterministic Analysis**
- Implement and test the keyword-based risk detection first
- Add LLM analysis only after the base system works
- Use deterministic as a validation baseline for LLM results

### **2. Customize Risk Keywords for Your Domain**
```python
# Example for Healthcare
high_risk_keywords = ['hipaa', 'patient-data', 'clinical-integration', 'fda-approval']

# Example for FinTech  
high_risk_keywords = ['regulatory', 'compliance', 'fraud-detection', 'real-time-payments']

# Example for E-commerce
high_risk_keywords = ['payment-processing', 'inventory-sync', 'real-time-pricing']
```

### **3. Risk Penalty Calibration**
```python
# Conservative approach (enterprise/regulated industries)
risk_penalty: float = 0.8  # High penalty discourages risky features

# Balanced approach (most teams)
risk_penalty: float = 0.5  # Moderate penalty for balanced decisions  

# Aggressive approach (startups/innovation teams)
risk_penalty: float = 0.2  # Low penalty encourages innovation despite risk
```

### **4. Monitor Agent Performance**
- Check that risk assessments align with your intuition
- Track delivery outcomes vs. risk predictions
- Adjust keywords and penalties based on real experience
