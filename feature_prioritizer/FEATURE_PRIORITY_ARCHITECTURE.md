## Executive Summary

This Feature Prioritization Assistant implements a **true agentic architecture** using **LangGraph**, where multiple specialized AI agents work autonomously to transform raw feature requirements into prioritized backlogs. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this solution employs intelligent agents that can reason, adapt, and enhance their outputs through Large Language Model (LLM) integration.

### Key Differentiators

- **Autonomous Agent Decision-Making**: Each agent operates independently with specialized knowledge
- **Semantic Understanding**: Deep contextual analysis beyond keyword matching
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: System learns from patterns and improves recommendations
- **Transparent Audit Trail**: Full visibility into agent decisions and reasoning
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works with or without LLM enhancement

---

## Prioritization Metrics Framework

The Feature Prioritization system supports three proven methodologies for scoring and ranking features. Each methodology provides a different lens for evaluating features based on organizational priorities and contexts.

### RICE Framework (Reach × Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort)

**RICE** is a comprehensive scoring framework developed by Intercom that quantifies feature value through four key dimensions:

#### Components of RICE

| **Factor** | **Definition** | **Scale** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Reach** | Number of users/customers affected per time period | Absolute numbers | 1000 users/month |
| **Impact** | Degree of positive effect on each user | 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 | 2 = High impact |
| **Confidence** | How certain you are about your estimates | Percentage | 80% = High confidence |
| **Effort** | Amount of work required (person-months) | Absolute numbers | 3 person-months |

#### RICE Calculation Formula

```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort
```

#### Agent Implementation

```python
def calculate_rice_score(feature: FeatureSpec, config: Config) -> float:
    """
    Calculate RICE score with agent-enhanced factor assessment
    """
    # Convert normalized factors to RICE scale
    reach = feature.reach * config.max_reach_per_period  # e.g., 0.8 × 10,000 = 8,000 users
    impact = convert_to_rice_impact(feature.revenue, feature.risk_reduction)  # 0.25-3 scale
    confidence = calculate_confidence(feature.llm_analysis, feature.heuristic_match)  # 0-100%
    effort = feature.engineering * config.max_effort_months  # e.g., 0.6 × 12 = 7.2 months
    
    rice_score = (reach * impact * confidence / 100) / max(effort, 0.1)
    
    return rice_score

def convert_to_rice_impact(revenue_factor: float, risk_factor: float) -> float:
    """
    Convert normalized factors to RICE impact scale (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
    """
    combined_impact = (revenue_factor * 0.7) + (risk_factor * 0.3)
    
    if combined_impact >= 0.9: return 3.0    # Massive impact
    elif combined_impact >= 0.7: return 2.0  # High impact
    elif combined_impact >= 0.5: return 1.0  # Medium impact
    elif combined_impact >= 0.3: return 0.5  # Low impact
    else: return 0.25                        # Minimal impact
```

#### When to Use RICE
- **Large organizations** with diverse user bases
- **Data-driven cultures** that value quantification
- **Strategic planning** requiring confidence tracking
- **Resource-constrained** environments needing effort optimization

#### RICE Advantages
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers all major prioritization dimensions
- ✅ **Quantitative**: Provides comparable numerical scores
- ✅ **Confidence-aware**: Incorporates uncertainty into decisions
- ✅ **Effort-conscious**: Explicitly considers resource requirements

#### RICE Limitations
- ❌ **Data-intensive**: Requires accurate reach and effort estimates
- ❌ **Complex**: Multiple variables can be overwhelming
- ❌ **Bias-prone**: Confidence scores can be subjective

---

### ICE Framework (Impact × Confidence × Ease)

**ICE** is a simplified scoring framework that emphasizes quick decision-making while maintaining rigor across three key dimensions:

#### Components of ICE

| **Factor** | **Definition** | **Scale** | **Interpretation** |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Impact** | Business value potential | 1-10 | 10 = Game-changing impact |
| **Confidence** | Certainty in your assessment | 1-10 | 10 = Completely certain |
| **Ease** | Implementation simplicity (inverse of effort) | 1-10 | 10 = Trivially easy |

#### ICE Calculation Formula

```
ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease
```

#### Agent Implementation

```python
def calculate_ice_score(feature: FeatureSpec, config: Config) -> float:
    """
    Calculate ICE score with agent-enhanced simplicity
    """
    # Convert normalized factors to 1-10 scale
    impact = calculate_ice_impact(feature.revenue, feature.reach, feature.risk_reduction)
    confidence = calculate_ice_confidence(feature.llm_analysis, feature.data_quality)
    ease = calculate_ice_ease(feature.engineering, feature.complexity, feature.dependency)
    
    ice_score = impact * confidence * ease
    
    return ice_score

def calculate_ice_impact(revenue: float, reach: float, risk: float) -> float:
    """
    Convert business factors to ICE impact (1-10 scale)
    """
    # Weighted combination of business value factors
    combined_impact = (revenue * 0.5) + (reach * 0.3) + (risk * 0.2)
    return 1 + (combined_impact * 9)  # Scale from 1-10

def calculate_ice_ease(engineering: float, complexity: float, dependency: float) -> float:
    """
    Convert effort factors to ICE ease (1-10 scale, where higher = easier)
    """
    # Combined effort assessment (inverted for ease)
    combined_effort = (engineering * 0.4) + (complexity * 0.35) + (dependency * 0.25)
    ease = 1 - combined_effort  # Invert: high effort = low ease
    return 1 + (ease * 9)  # Scale from 1-10
```

#### When to Use ICE
- **Fast-paced environments** requiring quick decisions
- **Early-stage companies** with limited data
- **Cross-functional teams** needing simple communication
- **Agile methodologies** emphasizing speed over precision

#### ICE Advantages
- ✅ **Simple**: Easy to understand and calculate
- ✅ **Fast**: Quick assessment and scoring
- ✅ **Intuitive**: Natural 1-10 scale interpretation
- ✅ **Flexible**: Adaptable to various contexts

#### ICE Limitations
- ❌ **Less granular**: May miss nuanced trade-offs
- ❌ **Subjective**: Relies heavily on intuition
- ❌ **Scale-sensitive**: Multiplication can amplify biases

---

### Impact-Effort Matrix (Simple Prioritization)

The **Impact-Effort Matrix** is a visual prioritization framework that plots features on a 2D grid to identify quick wins and strategic investments:

#### Framework Quadrants

```
High Impact, Low Effort    |    High Impact, High Effort
    "QUICK WINS"          |      "MAJOR PROJECTS"
    (Do First)            |      (Do Second)
--------------------------|---------------------------
Low Impact, Low Effort    |    Low Impact, High Effort
    "FILL-INS"           |       "THANKLESS TASKS"
    (Do Later)           |       (Avoid)
```

#### Scoring Approach

```python
def calculate_impact_effort_score(feature: FeatureSpec, config: Config) -> Tuple[float, str]:
    """
    Calculate Impact-Effort positioning and quadrant classification
    """
    # Calculate impact score (0-1 scale)
    impact = (
        feature.revenue * 0.4 +
        feature.reach * 0.3 +
        feature.risk_reduction * 0.3
    )
    
    # Calculate effort score (0-1 scale)
    effort = (
        feature.engineering * 0.4 +
        feature.complexity * 0.35 +
        feature.dependency * 0.25
    )
    
    # Classify into quadrants
    quadrant = classify_quadrant(impact, effort)
    
    # Priority score (impact/effort ratio)
    priority_score = impact / max(effort, 0.1)
    
    return priority_score, quadrant

def classify_quadrant(impact: float, effort: float) -> str:
    """
    Classify feature into Impact-Effort quadrant
    """
    high_impact = impact >= 0.6
    low_effort = effort <= 0.4
    
    if high_impact and low_effort:
        return "QUICK_WINS"
    elif high_impact and not low_effort:
        return "MAJOR_PROJECTS"
    elif not high_impact and low_effort:
        return "FILL_INS"
    else:
        return "THANKLESS_TASKS"
```

#### Quadrant-Based Prioritization

```python
def prioritize_by_quadrant(features: List[ScoredFeature]) -> List[ScoredFeature]:
    """
    Agent-based quadrant prioritization with smart ordering
    """
    quadrant_priority = {
        "QUICK_WINS": 1,      # Highest priority
        "MAJOR_PROJECTS": 2,  # Second priority
        "FILL_INS": 3,        # Third priority
        "THANKLESS_TASKS": 4  # Lowest priority
    }
    
    # Sort by quadrant, then by score within quadrant
    return sorted(features, key=lambda f: (
        quadrant_priority[f.quadrant],
        -f.score  # Higher scores first within quadrant
    ))
```

#### When to Use Impact-Effort
- **Visual teams** that benefit from spatial representation
- **Resource planning** requiring clear effort assessment
- **Portfolio balancing** across different effort levels
- **Stakeholder communication** needing simple visualization

#### Impact-Effort Advantages
- ✅ **Visual clarity**: Easy to see trade-offs at a glance
- ✅ **Strategic insight**: Identifies optimal feature types
- ✅ **Communication-friendly**: Intuitive for stakeholders
- ✅ **Action-oriented**: Clear guidance on what to do next

#### Impact-Effort Limitations
- ❌ **Binary thinking**: May oversimplify complex decisions
- ❌ **Static view**: Doesn't capture changing priorities
- ❌ **Context-light**: Limited business context consideration

---

### Agentic Metric Selection

The system's agents can intelligently select the most appropriate scoring methodology based on context:

```python
def select_optimal_methodology(context: PrioritizationContext, config: Config) -> str:
    """
    Agent selects best scoring methodology based on organizational context
    """
    if context.team_size > 50 and context.data_maturity == "high":
        return "RICE"  # Large, data-driven organizations
    
    elif context.decision_speed == "fast" and context.team_experience == "mixed":
        return "ICE"   # Fast-moving teams needing simplicity
    
    elif context.visual_preference and context.portfolio_planning:
        return "IMPACT_EFFORT"  # Strategic portfolio management
    
    else:
        return config.default_methodology  # Fallback to configuration
```

### Hybrid Approach Implementation

The agentic system can combine multiple methodologies for comprehensive analysis:

```python
def hybrid_scoring_analysis(feature: FeatureSpec, config: Config) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Agent provides multi-methodology analysis for comprehensive insight
    """
    return {
        "rice_score": calculate_rice_score(feature, config),
        "ice_score": calculate_ice_score(feature, config),
        "impact_effort": calculate_impact_effort_score(feature, config),
        "recommendation": select_primary_methodology(feature, config),
        "confidence": calculate_cross_methodology_confidence(feature),
        "rationale": generate_methodology_rationale(feature, config)
    }
```

This multi-methodology approach ensures that teams can leverage the most appropriate framework for their specific context while maintaining consistency and transparency in their prioritization decisions.

## What Makes This "Agentic"?

### Traditional Approach vs. Agentic Approach

| **Traditional Systems** | **Agentic Architecture** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| ❌ Static rule-based processing | ✅ Autonomous agent decision-making |
| ❌ Fixed, predefined workflows | ✅ Adaptive agent orchestration |
| ❌ Manual configuration required | ✅ Self-improving through LLM reasoning |
| ❌ No contextual understanding | ✅ Semantic analysis and learning |
| ❌ One-size-fits-all scoring | ✅ Context-aware factor assessment |

### Core Agentic Principles Implemented

1. **Autonomy**: Each agent operates independently with its own specialized knowledge
2. **Reasoning**: Agents can analyze context and make intelligent decisions
3. **Adaptability**: System learns from patterns and improves recommendations
4. **Collaboration**: Agents pass enriched data between stages
5. **Transparency**: Full audit trail of agent decisions and reasoning

    E --> L[Prioritized Backlog]
```

### Three Core Agents

#### 🤖 **Agent 1: Feature Extractor Agent**
- **Purpose**: Transforms raw feature descriptions into normalized, analyzable specifications
- **Intelligence**: Uses NLP and pattern recognition to extract business factors
- **LLM Enhancement**: Semantic analysis for reach, revenue impact, and risk assessment
- **Autonomy**: Makes decisions about factor weights based on context

```python
# Agentic Decision-Making Example
def extractor_node(state: State, config: Config) -> State:
    # Agent autonomously decides analysis approach
    if config.llm_enabled:
        # Use intelligent semantic analysis
        llm_analysis = _enhance_with_llm(feature_desc, config)
    else:
        # Fall back to heuristic analysis
        defaults = _infer_defaults(feature_desc, config)
```

#### 🎯 **Agent 2: Scoring Agent**
- **Purpose**: Computes impact and effort scores using configurable algorithms
- **Intelligence**: Applies business logic with contextual awareness
- **Adaptability**: Supports multiple scoring policies (RICE, ICE, Impact-Effort)
- **Reasoning**: Provides mathematical rationale for scoring decisions

#### 📊 **Agent 3: Prioritization Agent**
- **Purpose**: Orders features by priority and generates business rationale
- **Intelligence**: Creates actionable insights and recommendations
- **LLM Enhancement**: Generates executive-level rationale and strategic context
- **Transparency**: Documents decision-making process for stakeholders

### Agent Orchestration with LangGraph

#### State-Based Workflow Management

```python
# LangGraph State Definition
class State(TypedDict):
    raw: List[RawFeature]           # Input features
    extracted: ExtractorOutput     # Agent 1 output
    scored: ScorerOutput          # Agent 2 output  
    prioritized: PrioritizedOutput # Agent 3 output
    errors: List[str]             # Error tracking
```

#### Autonomous Agent Flow

```python
# Self-Managing Agent Pipeline
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("extract", extractor_with_config)
workflow.add_node("score", scorer_with_config)  
workflow.add_node("prioritize", prioritizer_with_config)

# Agents automatically pass state between stages
workflow.set_entry_point("extract")
workflow.add_edge("extract", "score")
workflow.add_edge("score", "prioritize")
```

---

## Enhanced Agentic Prompt Architecture

### Agent Identity and Role Definition

The system implements **proper agentic identity** where each LLM interaction begins with explicit agent role definition:

```python
# Feature Analysis Agent
prompt = f"""You are an agent for feature analysis and factor assessment. Your role is to analyze product features and estimate normalized business factors.

From the feature description below, estimate normalized factors in [0,1] range:
- reach: How many users/customers will this impact?
- revenue: How much will this contribute to revenue growth?
- risk_reduction: How much does this reduce business/technical risk?
- engineering: How much engineering effort is required?
- dependency: How many external dependencies/integrations?
- complexity: How complex is the implementation?

Feature Description: {feature_desc}

Return STRICT JSON with keys: reach, revenue, risk_reduction, engineering, dependency, complexity, notes (array of short analysis strings)."""

# Business Rationale Agent  
prompt = f"""You are an agent for business rationale generation. Your role is to create clear, actionable business justifications for feature prioritization decisions.

Analyze this feature's priority score and generate a concise business rationale..."""
```

### Key Benefits of Agentic Prompts

1. **Clear Role Boundaries**: Each agent knows its specific function and domain
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Agents maintain character across different feature types
3. **Structured Output**: Simplified JSON format focusing on core factors
4. **Enhanced Reasoning**: Agents understand they are autonomous decision-makers
5. **Improved Reliability**: More predictable responses due to clear expectations

---

## Agent Architecture Patterns

### 1. State-Based Agent Communication

The system implements the **Shared State Pattern** where agents communicate through a common state object:

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    raw: List[RawFeature]           # Input data
    extracted: ExtractorOutput     # Agent 1 → Agent 2
    scored: ScorerOutput          # Agent 2 → Agent 3  
    prioritized: PrioritizedOutput # Agent 3 → Output
    errors: List[str]             # Cross-agent error tracking
```

### 2. Agent Composition Pattern

Each agent is composed of multiple capability layers:

```python
class FeatureExtractorAgent:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.heuristic_layer = HeuristicAnalyzer(config)
        self.llm_layer = LLMEnhancer(config) if config.llm_enabled else None
        self.validator = OutputValidator()
    
    def extract(self, features: List[RawFeature]) -> List[FeatureSpec]:
        # Layer composition for robust analysis
        base_analysis = self.heuristic_layer.analyze(features)
        if self.llm_layer:
            enhanced_analysis = self.llm_layer.enhance(base_analysis)
            return self.validator.validate(enhanced_analysis)
        return self.validator.validate(base_analysis)
```

### 3. LLM Integration Pattern

Agents use the **Enhancement Decorator Pattern** for LLM integration:

```python
def _enhance_with_llm(feature_desc: str, config: Config) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    LLM enhancement layer that can be toggled on/off
    """
    if not config.llm_enabled:
        return {}  # Graceful degradation
    
    try:
        # Structured prompt engineering
        response = call_openai_json(
            model=config.llm_model,
            prompt=construct_analysis_prompt(feature_desc),
            temperature=config.llm_temperature
        )
        return response
    except Exception:
        # Transparent fallback
        print("⚠️ LLM enhancement failed, using heuristics")
        return {}
```

---

## LangGraph Orchestration Details

### Workflow Definition

```python
def build_graph(config: Config) -> CompiledGraph:
    """
    Build the agentic workflow with LangGraph
    """
    workflow = StateGraph(State)
    
    # Agent node definitions
    workflow.add_node("extract", create_extractor_node(config))
    workflow.add_node("score", create_scorer_node(config))
    workflow.add_node("prioritize", create_prioritizer_node(config))
    
    # Agent communication edges
    workflow.set_entry_point("extract")
    workflow.add_edge("extract", "score")
    workflow.add_edge("score", "prioritize")
    workflow.add_edge("prioritize", END)
    
    return workflow.compile()
```

### State Management

```python
def update_state_safely(current_state: State, updates: Dict[str, Any]) -> State:
    """
    Safe state updates with validation and error tracking
    """
    try:
        # Validate state transitions
        validate_state_transition(current_state, updates)
        
        # Apply updates
        new_state = {**current_state, **updates}
        
        # Track state changes for observability
        log_state_change(current_state, new_state)
        
        return new_state
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Error recovery
        error_msg = f"State update failed: {str(e)}"
        current_state.setdefault("errors", []).append(error_msg)
        return current_state
```

### Error Propagation

```python
def handle_agent_error(agent_name: str, error: Exception, state: State) -> State:
    """
    Centralized error handling across all agents
    """
    error_entry = {
        "agent": agent_name,
        "error": str(error),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "state_snapshot": serialize_state(state)
    }
    
    state.setdefault("errors", []).append(error_entry)
    
    # Log for observability
    logger.error(f"Agent {agent_name} error", extra=error_entry)
    
    return state
```

---

## LLM Reasoning Implementation

### Structured Prompt Engineering

The system uses **structured prompts** for consistent LLM reasoning:

```python
def construct_analysis_prompt(feature_desc: str) -> str:
    """
    Engineered prompt for consistent LLM analysis with proper agent definition
    """
    return f"""You are an agent for feature analysis and factor assessment. Your role is to analyze product features and estimate normalized business factors.

From the feature description below, estimate normalized factors in [0,1] range:
- reach: How many users/customers will this impact? (0.0=very few, 1.0=almost all)
- revenue: How much will this contribute to revenue growth? (0.0=none, 1.0=significant)  
- risk_reduction: How much does this reduce business/technical risk? (0.0=none, 1.0=critical)
- engineering: How much engineering effort is required? (0.0=minimal, 1.0=massive)
- dependency: How many external dependencies/integrations? (0.0=none, 1.0=many complex)
- complexity: How complex is the implementation? (0.0=trivial, 1.0=extremely complex)

Feature Description: {feature_desc}

Return STRICT JSON with keys: reach, revenue, risk_reduction, engineering, dependency, complexity, notes (array of short analysis strings).

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "reach": 0.5,
  "revenue": 0.5,
  "risk_reduction": 0.5,
  "engineering": 0.5,
  "dependency": 0.5,
  "complexity": 0.5,
  "notes": ["analysis point 1", "analysis point 2", "analysis point 3"]
}}"""
```

### Response Validation and Fallback

```python
def validate_llm_response(response: Dict[str, Any], feature_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Validate LLM response structure and apply fallbacks
    """
    required_fields = ['reach', 'revenue', 'risk_reduction', 'engineering', 'dependency', 'complexity']
    
    # Structure validation
    if not isinstance(response, dict):
        raise ValueError("Response must be a dictionary")
    
    # Field validation
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in response:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        
        value = response[field]
        if not isinstance(value, (int, float)) or not (0 <= value <= 1):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid value for {field}: {value}")
    
    # Notes validation
    if 'notes' in response and not isinstance(response['notes'], list):
        response['notes'] = []
    
    return response

def llm_with_fallback(feature_desc: str, config: Config) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    LLM analysis with automatic fallback to heuristics
    """
    try:
        raw_response = call_openai_json(
            model=config.llm_model,
            prompt=construct_analysis_prompt(feature_desc),
            temperature=config.llm_temperature,
            timeout=config.llm_timeout
        )
        
        return validate_llm_response(raw_response)
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"LLM analysis failed, using fallback: {e}")
        return heuristic_analysis_fallback(feature_desc, config)
```

### LLM-Enhanced Intelligence Layer

The system employs **GPT-4** and other advanced models to perform deep analysis:

```python
def _enhance_with_llm(feature_desc: str, config: Config) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """

### Key Agentic Capabilities

#### 1. **Proper Agent Identity and Role Definition**
- All agents are explicitly defined with clear roles and responsibilities
- **Feature Analysis Agent**: "You are an agent for feature analysis and factor assessment"
- **Rationale Generation Agent**: "You are an agent for business rationale generation"
- Each agent understands its specific domain expertise and decision-making scope

#### 2. **Semantic Understanding**
- Agents understand business context, not just keywords
- Example: "ML-powered search" → Agent recognizes high engineering effort + high user value

#### 3. **Adaptive Reasoning**
- Agents adjust recommendations based on domain context
- Example: E-commerce features weighted differently than B2B tools

#### 4. **Structured Output with Analysis Insights**
- Agents provide structured JSON responses with analysis notes
- Output includes both quantified factors and qualitative insights
- Example: `{"reach": 0.8, "notes": ["broad user impact", "high market visibility", "cross-platform benefits"]}`

#### 5. **Confidence Tracking**
- Agents can express uncertainty and provide confidence indicators
- Transparent about analysis limitations and assumptions

#### 6. **Graceful Degradation**
- If LLM unavailable, agents fall back to heuristic analysis
- System never fails completely, maintains availability

## Agent Intelligence Mechanisms

### 1. Contextual Factor Analysis

```python
def contextual_analysis(feature: FeatureSpec, domain_context: str, config: Config) -> FeatureSpec:
    """
    Agents adapt their analysis based on business domain context
    """
    domain_multipliers = {
        "fintech": {"risk_reduction": 1.2, "engineering": 1.1},
        "healthcare": {"risk_reduction": 1.3, "complexity": 1.1},
        "ecommerce": {"revenue": 1.2, "reach": 1.1},
        "enterprise": {"dependency": 1.2, "engineering": 1.1}
    }
    
    if domain_context in domain_multipliers:
        multipliers = domain_multipliers[domain_context]
        for factor, multiplier in multipliers.items():
            current_value = getattr(feature, factor)
            setattr(feature, factor, min(1.0, current_value * multiplier))
    
    return feature
```

### 2. Contextual Scoring Logic

```python
def scorer_node(state: State, config: Config) -> State:
    """
    Agent applies configurable scoring algorithms
    """
    scored_features = []
    
    for feature in state.get('extracted', {}).get('features', []):
        # Calculate impact and effort based on policy
        if config.scoring_policy.name == "RICE":
            impact = calculate_rice_impact(feature)
            effort = calculate_rice_effort(feature)
            score = impact / max(effort, 0.1)  # Avoid division by zero
            
        elif config.scoring_policy.name == "ICE":
            impact = calculate_ice_impact(feature)
            effort = calculate_ice_effort(feature)
            score = impact / max(effort, 0.1)
            
        # Generate rationale (LLM-enhanced or template-based)
        rationale = _generate_rationale(feature, config) or f"Scored using {config.scoring_policy.name}"
        
        scored_features.append(ScoredFeature(
            name=feature.name,
            impact=impact,
            effort=effort, 
            score=score,
            rationale=rationale
        ))
    
    return {**state, 'scored': ScorerOutput(scored=scored_features)}
```

### 3. Intelligent Rationale Generation

```python
def _generate_rationale(feature: ScoredFeature, config: Config) -> str:
    """
    Agent generates business rationale with LLM enhancement
    """
    if config.llm_enabled:
        prompt = f"""You are an agent for business rationale generation. Your role is to create clear, actionable business justifications for feature prioritization decisions.

        try:
            rationale = call_openai_completion(
                model=config.llm_model,
                prompt=prompt,
                temperature=0.3,
                max_tokens=150
            )
            return rationale.strip()
        except Exception:
            pass
    
    # Fallback to template-based rationale
    return generate_template_rationale(feature)

```

### Phase 2: LLM-Enhanced Intelligence
```bash
# Add AI reasoning capabilities
python run.py --file features.json --llm --model gpt-4o-mini --auto-save
```

### Phase 3: Custom Agent Configuration

## Comparison with Traditional Solutions

### Traditional Implementation

```python
# Static, rule-based approach
def traditional_prioritization(features):
    for feature in features:
        # Fixed scoring logic
        if "payment" in feature.name.lower():
            feature.revenue_score = 0.8
        elif "ui" in feature.name.lower():
            feature.revenue_score = 0.3
        
        # Manual effort estimation
        feature.effort_score = estimate_effort_manually(feature)
        
        # Simple formula
        feature.priority = feature.revenue_score / feature.effort_score
    
    return sorted(features, key=lambda f: f.priority, reverse=True)
```

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Static keyword matching
- ❌ No contextual understanding
- ❌ Manual effort estimation required
- ❌ No rationale or transparency

### Agentic Implementation

```python
# Intelligent, adaptive approach
def extractor_node(state: State, config: Config) -> State:
    # Agent reasons about the feature
    llm_analysis = _enhance_with_llm(feature_desc, config)
    
    # Contextual decision-making
    if llm_analysis.confidence == "high":
        use_llm_factors(llm_analysis)
