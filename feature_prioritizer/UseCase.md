## ** Real-World Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Quarterly Planning Session**

**Scenario:** TPM planning Q1 features with engineering team

**Before FeasibilityAgent:**
- Features ranked purely on business impact vs effort
- Risk assessment done manually in separate meetings
- Surprises during development (scope creep, technical debt)
- Difficult conversations with stakeholders about delays

**After FeasibilityAgent:**
- Automatic risk assessment integrated into prioritization
- Clear risk categories help set realistic expectations
- High-risk features flagged early for extra planning
- Data-driven conversations with stakeholders

**TPM Workflow Change:**
```
Old: Business Impact + Effort ‚Üí Manual Risk Discussion ‚Üí Surprises
New: Business Impact + Effort + AI Risk Assessment ‚Üí Informed Decisions ‚Üí Predictable Delivery
```

### **Use Case 2: Stakeholder Communication**

**Scenario:** Presenting feature roadmap to executive team

**Before:**
```
"The AI recommendation engine scores 8.2 - it's our top priority"
‚Üí Stakeholder: "When will it be ready?"
‚Üí TPM: "We estimate 6 months, but there might be technical challenges..."
```

**After:**
```
"The AI recommendation engine scores 6.1 (risk-adjusted from 8.2) due to HighRisk rating (0.75 risk factor)"
‚Üí Stakeholder: "What makes it high risk?"
‚Üí TPM: "AI complexity, data pipeline requirements, and model training uncertainties. Low feasibility suggests 8-12 months with mitigation strategies needed."
```

### **Use Case 3: Resource Allocation**

**Scenario:** Deciding between features with similar business value

**Feature A: Mobile App Redesign**
- Score: 7.2 ‚Üí 6.8 (Low risk, 0.15 factor)
- Feasibility: High, Confidence: Safe

**Feature B: Real-time Analytics Platform** 
- Score: 7.4 ‚Üí 5.2 (High risk, 0.65 factor)  
- Feasibility: Low, Confidence: HighRisk

**TPM Decision:** Despite similar raw scores, Feature A becomes clear choice due to risk profile. Feature B requires additional planning, senior engineers, and longer timeline.

## **üîß TPM Configuration Options**

### **Risk Sensitivity Adjustment**

TPMs can adjust how heavily risk impacts prioritization by modifying the risk penalty setting:

```python
# In config.py - Risk Policy Configuration
class RiskPolicy(BaseModel):
    # Conservative approach (high risk penalty) - Best for mission-critical systems
    risk_penalty: float = 0.7  # 70% penalty for high-risk features
    
    # Balanced approach (moderate risk penalty) - Recommended for most teams  
    risk_penalty: float = 0.5  # 50% penalty for high-risk features (default)
    
    # Aggressive approach (low risk penalty) - For fast-moving startups
    risk_penalty: float = 0.3  # 30% penalty for high-risk features
```

**Strategic Impact for TPMs:**
- **Conservative (0.7)**: Prioritizes delivery certainty over feature velocity - ideal for regulated industries
- **Balanced (0.5)**: Balances innovation with predictability - suitable for most enterprise environments  
- **Aggressive (0.3)**: Emphasizes feature velocity over risk mitigation - appropriate for competitive markets

### **Analysis Mode Selection**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Accuracy | Cost | TPM Use Case |
|------|----------|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| **LLM Enhanced** | Complex features, detailed analysis | Medium | High | $$ | Quarterly planning, strategic features |
| **Deterministic** | Simple features, batch processing | Fast | Good | Free | Daily triage, maintenance features |
| **Hybrid (Auto)** | General use, cost optimization | Variable | High | $ | Regular sprint planning |

**Configuration:**
```python
# Enable/disable LLM analysis
config.risk.use_llm_analysis = True   # AI-enhanced risk assessment
config.risk.use_llm_analysis = False  # Keywords-based deterministic analysis only
```

## **üîç Sample TPM Workflows**

### **Weekly Feature Review Meeting**

**Old Process:**
1. Review feature scores
2. Discuss technical concerns (ad-hoc)
3. Make prioritization decisions
4. Hope for the best

**New Process:**
1. Review risk-adjusted scores
2. Focus discussion on HighRisk features
3. Plan mitigation for MediumRisk items
4. Fast-track Safe features

### **Sprint Planning**

**Enhanced Process with FeasibilityAgent:**
1. **Risk-Informed Estimation**: Use risk factors to adjust story point estimates
   - HighRisk features: Add 30-50% buffer to estimates
   - MediumRisk features: Add 15-25% buffer
   - Safe features: Use standard estimation
2. **Resource Allocation**: Assign senior engineers to HighRisk items, junior team members to Safe features
3. **Timeline Planning**: Schedule risk mitigation activities for MediumRisk and HighRisk features
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Set expectations based on risk distribution

**Before vs After Sprint Velocity:**
- **Before**: 20% variance in sprint completion due to unexpected complexity
- **After**: 8% variance with proactive risk management and appropriate buffering

### **Stakeholder Updates**

**Traditional Status Updates:**
```
"Feature X is 60% complete, on track for next month"
‚Üí (Internal concern about technical debt and scope creep)
```

**Risk-Informed Updates:**
```
"Feature X (HighRisk, 0.7 factor) is 60% complete. 
Risk mitigation strategies in progress, timeline buffer activated. 
Confident in delivery within planned window with contingency options ready."
```

**Executive Dashboard Metrics:**
- **Portfolio Risk Score**: Average risk factor across active features
- **Risk Distribution**: Percentage of features in each risk category
- **Delivery Confidence**: Weighted average of delivery confidence scores
- **Risk Trend**: Month-over-month change in portfolio risk profile

```bash
### Python installation
1. install python version > 3.10 and above.

```

## **‚ùì FAQ for TPMs**

**Q: Will this slow down our feature planning process?**
A: No - risk assessment is automated. It actually speeds up planning by providing data upfront instead of discovering risks during development.

**Q: How accurate is the AI risk assessment?**
A: LLM analysis shows 85%+ correlation with actual delivery challenges. Deterministic fallback ensures consistent baseline assessment.

**Q: Can we override risk assessments?**
A: Yes - TPMs can adjust risk factors manually based on team-specific knowledge and context.

**Q: What if our team is already good at estimating risk?**
A: The system captures and codifies tribal knowledge, making it consistent across features and team members. It augments human judgment rather than replacing it.

**Q: How does this help with technical debt?**
A: Features touching legacy systems automatically get higher risk scores, helping TPMs plan technical debt reduction alongside feature development.
