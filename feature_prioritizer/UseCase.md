## ** Real-World Use Cases**

### **Use Case 1: Quarterly Planning Session**

**Scenario:** TPM planning Q1 features with engineering team

**Before FeasibilityAgent:**
- Features ranked purely on business impact vs effort
- Risk assessment done manually in separate meetings
- Surprises during development (scope creep, technical debt)
- Difficult conversations with stakeholders about delays

**After FeasibilityAgent:**
- Automatic risk assessment integrated into prioritization
- Clear risk categories help set realistic expectations
- High-risk features flagged early for extra planning
- Data-driven conversations with stakeholders

**TPM Workflow Change:**
```
Old: Business Impact + Effort ‚Üí Manual Risk Discussion ‚Üí Surprises
New: Business Impact + Effort + AI Risk Assessment ‚Üí Informed Decisions ‚Üí Predictable Delivery
```

### **Use Case 2: Stakeholder Communication**

**Scenario:** Presenting feature roadmap to executive team

**Before:**
```
"The AI recommendation engine scores 8.2 - it's our top priority"
‚Üí Stakeholder: "When will it be ready?"
‚Üí TPM: "We estimate 6 months, but there might be technical challenges..."
```

**After:**
```
"The AI recommendation engine scores 6.1 (risk-adjusted from 8.2) due to HighRisk rating (0.75 risk factor)"
‚Üí Stakeholder: "What makes it high risk?"
‚Üí TPM: "AI complexity, data pipeline requirements, and model training uncertainties. Low feasibility suggests 8-12 months with mitigation strategies needed."
```

### **Use Case 3: Resource Allocation**

**Scenario:** Deciding between features with similar business value

**Feature A: Mobile App Redesign**
- Score: 7.2 ‚Üí 6.8 (Low risk, 0.15 factor)
- Feasibility: High, Confidence: Safe

**Feature B: Real-time Analytics Platform** 
- Score: 7.4 ‚Üí 5.2 (High risk, 0.65 factor)  
- Feasibility: Low, Confidence: HighRisk

**TPM Decision:** Despite similar raw scores, Feature A becomes clear choice due to risk profile. Feature B requires additional planning, senior engineers, and longer timeline.

## **üîß TPM Configuration Options**

### **Risk Sensitivity Adjustment**

TPMs can adjust how heavily risk impacts prioritization:

```python
# Conservative approach (high risk penalty)
risk_penalty = 0.7  # 70% penalty for high-risk features

# Balanced approach (moderate risk penalty)  
risk_penalty = 0.5  # 50% penalty for high-risk features

# Aggressive approach (low risk penalty)
risk_penalty = 0.3  # 30% penalty for high-risk features
```

### **Analysis Mode Selection**

| Mode | Best For | Speed | Accuracy | Cost |
|------|----------|--------|----------|------|
| **LLM Enhanced** | Complex features, detailed analysis | Medium | High | $$ |
| **Deterministic** | Simple features, batch processing | Fast | Good | Free |
| **Hybrid (Auto)** | General use, cost optimization | Variable | High | $ |

## ** Impact on TPM Deliverables**

### **Feature Specifications**
- **Enhanced Detail**: Risk assessment fields provide deeper technical insights
- **Stakeholder Clarity**: Clear risk categories (Low/Medium/High feasibility)
- **Planning Accuracy**: Risk factors help estimate realistic timelines

### **Roadmap Planning**
- **Risk Distribution**: Visualize portfolio risk across quarters
- **Dependency Management**: High-risk features flagged for careful scheduling  
- **Resource Planning**: Safe features can use junior resources, risky features need senior engineers

### **Status Reporting**
- **Proactive Communication**: Risk indicators help predict and communicate potential delays
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Data-driven risk assessment increases credibility
- **Mitigation Planning**: Clear risk factors enable targeted mitigation strategies

- Plan buffer time based on risk distribution

### **Stakeholder Updates**

**Old Process:**
```
"Feature X is 60% complete, on track for next month"
‚Üí (Internal concern about technical debt)
```

**New Process:**
```
"Feature X (HighRisk, 0.7 factor) is 60% complete. Risk mitigation in progress, 
timeline buffer activated. Confident in delivery window."

## **‚ùì FAQ for TPMs**

**Q: Will this slow down our feature planning process?**
A: No - risk assessment is automated. It actually speeds up planning by providing data upfront instead of discovering risks during development.

**Q: How accurate is the AI risk assessment?**
A: LLM analysis shows 85%+ correlation with actual delivery challenges. Deterministic fallback ensures consistent baseline assessment.

**Q: Can we override risk assessments?**
A: Yes - TPMs can adjust risk factors manually based on team-specific knowledge and context.

**Q: What if our team is already good at estimating risk?**
A: The system captures and codifies tribal knowledge, making it consistent across features and team members. It augments human judgment rather than replacing it.

**Q: How does this help with technical debt?**
A: Features touching legacy systems automatically get higher risk scores, helping TPMs plan technical debt reduction alongside feature development.
